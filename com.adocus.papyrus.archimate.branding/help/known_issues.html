<h1>Known issues</h1>
Below are some known issues that at the time for release of this add-in have not been solved. However, we and others within the open source community continually work to improve the add-in.

<ul>
<li>New models need to be "migrated", i.e. the migration dialog is shown even for new models</li>
<li>Elements can not be dropped directly to Grouping, they have to be created to the side of the Grouping element and after that "dragged" onto it</li>
<li>Some relations do not reflect correct appearence according to ArchiMate specification based upon exceptions in Papyrus when trying to do so</li>
</ul>
